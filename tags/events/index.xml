      <description>Alexander Knorr spent two semesters with the first and the second batch and one semester with the third batch. He had the role of a tutor on Computational Neuroscience and Statistics and Probability, was always present on the lectures and not only that! He joined the TUM Campus run under the group name &amp;ldquo;Neuruns&amp;rdquo; together with some students and some other faculty associates.
When Prof. Glasauer left LMU last semester, Alex continued to support Prof.</description>

      <title>15x4 Munich</title>

      <description>At the beginning when we (as a second batch of MSNE) started this program, Steffen shared one event with us. It was about 4 lectures that were 15 minutes each and mostly related to Neuroscience. Around 10 fresh minds, eager for new knowledge, especially if related to neuroscience, went to the event. It left me a very good impression and after this event, the events from 15x4 Munich were visited regularly by students from our program.</description>

      <description>The Neuroengineering Matinee took place the morning of the 16th of January at the Vorhoelzer Forum. Led by Professor Jakob Macke, two guest talks were held:
 Patrick van der Smagt, Volkswagen: Latent Optimal Control Srinivas Turaga, HHMI&amp;rsquo;s Janelia Research Campus: Connecting the Structure and Function of Neural Circuits  Afterwards, MSNE students held a presentation and poster session, introducing the audience to the research projects carried out during the program:</description>

      <description>The Bernstein Conference for Computational Neuroscience took place at the end of September in Berlin. A group of students from MSNE attended the conference and Vanessa and Mohammad presented a poster from their research projects.
There were a lot of wonderful talks and posters, including a talk from Dr. James DiCarlo from MIT who discussed “Reverse engineering human visual intelligence” that was particularly exciting, and a talk from Tatjana Tchumatchenko from the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research (Frankfurt, Germany) on “How to understand neural network dynamics via intracellular dynamics”.</description>

      <title>Farewell dinner with Professor Glasauer</title>

      <description>Stefan Glasauer, one of MSNE&amp;rsquo;s most iconic Professors, will take some distance from the program at the end of this semester as he is starting a new research group at the TU Cottbus. Fortunately for future generations of MSNE students, Prof. Glasauer will still visit us in Munich from time to time to give his beloved lectures.
We did not want to let him go without a proper farewell, so on Monday the 6th of August many of us students gathered with him in the Hofbräukeller Biergarten to have dinner together.</description>

      <description>In June, Nicolas and I made our way to Tübingen to attend the German-Israeli Conference on Clinical Neurotechnologies and Healthy Aging.
The focus lay on brain stimulation which could even be tested during the coffee breaks (I prefer not to show the video of my involuntarily kicking legs here). When speaking of the &amp;lsquo;brain&amp;rsquo; the retina is also meant (of course).
On the last day the MedTech Startup School offered an Open Innovation Day where we discussed several aspects of founding a Neuro-Tech start-up.</description>

      <title>MSNE Journal Club</title>
      <link>https://neuroengineering.blog/2018/06/24/msne-journal-club/</link>

      <guid>https://neuroengineering.blog/2018/06/24/msne-journal-club/</guid>
      <description>Why a Journal Club? Science communication is an essential aspect of scientific research. It enables scientists and researchers to inform each other, as well as the public, about science progress and invoke scientific, political and ethical thinking. The general purpose of a journal club is to facilitate the review of research studies and to discuss implications of the study in practice. In general, a journal club helps with:
 Sharing knowledge of current research Facilitating the learning process Enhancing literature critique and appraisal skills Encouraging interaction and dialogue with other researchers Encouraging research utilization, and Promoting team building  Neuroengineering Journal Club (NJC) is all about the above-mentioned objectives.</description>

      <description>From 9th to 16th March, MSNE students Auguste, Pranshul, Steffen and Nicolas attended the Interdisciplinary College (IK) in Günne. Since 1997, this annual spring school brings together students and researchers from the fields of computational neuroscience, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, robotics, cognitive sciences and philosophy.
The overall topic of this year Me, Myself and I was approached from various different angles through the lenses of the different scientific disciplines.
Among many other lectures, we enthusiastically attended the lecture series of MSNE faculty Prof.</description>

      <description>While walking through the aisles on a train to Heidelberg, I finally stumble upon my reserved seat&amp;hellip; Only to find it and its neighbors are surrounded by a family of 20. Rather than making a fuss - I go ahead and choose an unoccupied seat farther back, hoping to get some sleep in preparation for what I&amp;rsquo;m imagining will be a long three days. At the next stop, I&amp;rsquo;m roused awake by somebody asking in a distinct American accent &amp;ldquo;Is this seat available?</description>

      <description>After a semester of interesting theoretical lectures in neuroanatomy and neurophysiology we had the chance of gaining practical hands-on experience about the human brain in the Munich Brain Course.
The Munich Brain Course is a yearly intensive course on neuroanatomy organized by the Institute of Anatomy of the Ludwig Maximilians University (LMU) - the non-technical university in Munich.
The course started in the morning with a nice welcome buffet. Strengthened by the snacks and the coffee, we learned about the century-long history of neuroscience research in Munich and about the structure and organization of the course during an introductory talk and then had the pleasure to hear from Prof.</description>

      <description>On Dec. 9th we met with the MSNE program manager, Florian Rattei, at one of the many Christkindl-Markets in Munich for some nice hot Glühwein.
The medival-themed market with its many craftsmen and -women including a glassblower, a goldsmith and calligraphers as well as the authentic wooden stalls immediately makes one forget the stressful daily routine and emits a traditional Christmassy atmosphere.
Standing around a stump that served as a table for our Glühwein cups, we also talked about organisational matters and planned activities like the writing of this blog.</description>

This blog serves two purposes:
 We want to write a diary about the many great things that we are doing and experiencing. The blog is also supposed to give information to students interested in joining the program.
