      <description>Germany’s most awaited football tournament, the Champions’ League Elite Cup, was held on Saturday 22ndof June 2019 in Regensburg. Once again, the MSNE football team, the Neuruns, picked up the call of duty.
Despite terrible weather forecasts, which prognosed heavy storms throughout the day, the Neuruns decided to go at the last moment (literally), and so they boarded the train towards glory, with an inherited objective: score a goal and break the curse!</description>

      <description>The third MSNE retreat started on 30th of May - in a very picturesque village called Brixlegg in Tyrol, Austria - and of course it couldn&#39;t start without adventures from the beginning. We&#39;ll try to share with you the amazing neuro-weekend we spent together.
First day First thing we remember is how Aleks, Nogay, Tanya and our awesome organizers (Mel, Fulvia and Adrià) were trying to take all the cookies and other less important things from Adrià&#39;s place - and almost missed the bus since the driver was expecting to be leaving earlier.</description>
