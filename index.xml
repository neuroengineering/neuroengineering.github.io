      <description>At the beginning when we (as a second batch of MSNE) started this program, Steffen shared one event with us. It was about 4 lectures that were 15 minutes each and mostly related to Neuroscience. Around 10 fresh minds, eager for new knowledge, especially if related to neuroscience, went to the event. It left me a very good impression and after this event, the events from 15x4 Munich were visited regularly by students from our program.</description>

      <description>Science communication is an essential aspect of scientific research. It enables scientists and researchers to inform each other, as well as the public, about science progress and invoke scientific, political and ethical thinking. The general purpose of a journal club is to facilitate the review of research studies and to discuss implications of the study in practice. In general, a journal club helps with:
 Sharing knowledge of current research Facilitating the learning process Enhancing literature critique and appraisal skills Encouraging interaction and dialogue with other researchers Encouraging research utilization, and Promoting team building  The Neuroengineering Journal Club (NJC) is all about the above-mentioned objectives.</description>

      <description>The Bernstein Conference for Computational Neuroscience took place at the end of September in Berlin. A group of students from MSNE attended the conference and Vanessa and Mohammad presented a poster from their research projects.
There were a lot of wonderful talks and posters, including a talk from Dr. James DiCarlo from MIT who discussed “Reverse engineering human visual intelligence” that was particularly exciting, and a talk from Tatjana Tchumatchenko from the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research (Frankfurt, Germany) on “How to understand neural network dynamics via intracellular dynamics”.</description>

      <description>Stefan Glasauer, one of MSNE&amp;rsquo;s most iconic Professors, will take some distance from the program at the end of this semester as he is starting a new research group at the TU Cottbus. Fortunately for future generations of MSNE students, Prof. Glasauer will still visit us in Munich from time to time to give his beloved lectures.
We did not want to let him go without a proper farewell, so on Monday the 6th of August many of us students gathered with him in the Hofbräukeller Biergarten to have dinner together.</description>

      <description>As our co-director Prof. Jörg Conradt will be moving to KTH (Sweden) in August to build up a research group there, Auguste and I organized a farewell party for him. With support from the Institute for Electrical Energy Storage Technology, we set up a bunch of tables in the backyard of the Karlsstraße university building and everyone of us neuroengineering students brought some food. Mirroring the diversity of our nationalities we had a plethora of tasty dishes, from Bavarian brezels and Italian caprese salad to great eastern dishes that I can&amp;rsquo;t remember the names of.</description>

      <title>RobotCare - Future of Care between Human and Machine</title>

      <guid>https://neuroengineering.blog/2018/07/02/robotcare-future-of-care-between-human-and-machine/</guid>
      <description>Once we grow old, will we still be cared for by humans or will robots have taken over?
According to Science and Technology Studies (STS) this is the wrong question to ask. There is no technological determinism - the course of technological development is not written in stone - we humans have the ultimate say in the matter of what becomes reality and what doesn&amp;rsquo;t, or at least we can play a role in the complex interplay of social and technical factors.</description>

      <description>In June, Nicolas and I made our way to Tübingen to attend the German-Israeli Conference on Clinical Neurotechnologies and Healthy Aging.
The focus lay on brain stimulation which could even be tested during the coffee breaks (I prefer not to show the video of my involuntarily kicking legs here). When speaking of the &amp;lsquo;brain&amp;rsquo; the retina is also meant (of course).
On the last day the MedTech Startup School offered an Open Innovation Day where we discussed several aspects of founding a Neuro-Tech start-up.</description>

      <description>In February, Raja, Abdallah, James and Nicolas had the chance to attend the first student conference of the European Human Brain Project in Vienna. This study trip was carried out within the MSNE program and was supported by the Elite Network of Barvaria (ENB).
Having already brought our suitcases to the final exam in Computational Neuroscience, we started our trip directly after handing in our solutions. Late in the evening, after a four-hour train ride, we finally arrived in Vienna and checked in at our hotel which was in walking distance to the university of Vienna where the conference was hosted.</description>

      <description>On Dec. 9th we met with the MSNE program manager, Florian Rattei, at one of the many Christkindl-Markets in Munich for some nice hot Glühwein.
The medival-themed market with its many craftsmen and -women including a glassblower, a goldsmith and calligraphers as well as the authentic wooden stalls immediately makes one forget the stressful daily routine and emits a traditional Christmassy atmosphere.
Standing around a stump that served as a table for our Glühwein cups, we also talked about organisational matters and planned activities like the writing of this blog.</description>

      <description>Report about Research Visit at Emory University, USA Jonas Braun, 21.02.2019
During the summer of 2018 I joined Prof. Chethan Pandarinath&amp;rsquo;s Systems Neural Engineering Lab at the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Tech and Emory University in Atlanta, USA, as a summer research intern. The lab is located at the Emory campus and is working on &amp;ldquo;understanding how large populations of neurons in the brain perform computations and represent intention&amp;rdquo; (from snel.</description>
